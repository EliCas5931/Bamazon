# Bamazon

The objective of Bamazon was to create an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL and Node. 

With bamazonCustomer.js, this file will show a display of all the items available for sale. 
It includes the Ids, names, prices, and quantities per item. 

After displaying the items, the application will prompt you with the message of 
"What is the ID of the product you would like to buy?"

Once you input a valid ID, the second message will ask you
"How many units of the product would you like to buy?"

The application will then calculate your total and show you the amount for item(s).
After this, the user will then be prompted to either contiue shopping or to quit.

Below is a video of the basic operation of this application.
